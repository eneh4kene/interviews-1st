# AI Apply System Implementation

## Overview

The AI Apply system is a core feature of InterviewsFirst that allows talent managers to automatically apply for jobs on behalf of their clients using AI-generated applications. This system provides full transparency and worker control while enhancing productivity.

## Architecture

### Core Services

1. **ClientEmailService** - Manages client-specific email addresses
2. **AiApplyService** - Orchestrates AI-powered job applications  
3. **AiApplicationQueue** - Manages the processing queue for applications
4. **EmailService** - Enhanced email delivery system

### Database Schema

The system uses the following new tables:

- `client_emails` - Client-specific email addresses
- `ai_applications` - AI application tracking
- `client_email_templates` - Custom email templates per client
- `application_queue` - Processing queue management
- `email_discovery_results` - Cached email discovery results

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

- [x] Database schema with all required tables
- [x] ClientEmailService for email management
- [x] AiApplyService for application orchestration
- [x] AiApplicationQueue for processing management
- [x] API endpoints for all AI Apply functionality
- [x] AiApplicationsTab component for the frontend
- [x] Integration with existing JobDiscoveryTab
- [x] Client dashboard integration

### ðŸ”„ Current Status

The AI Apply system is now ready for testing and integration. The core services are implemented and the frontend components are integrated into the client dashboard.

## API Endpoints

### AI Apply Endpoints

- `POST /api/ai-apply/submit` - Submit new AI application
- `POST /api/ai-apply/approve` - Approve application with edits
- `POST /api/ai-apply/reject` - Reject application with reason
- `GET /api/ai-apply/applications/[clientId]` - Get applications for client
- `GET /api/ai-apply/application/[id]` - Get single application

### Client Email Endpoints

- `GET /api/client-emails/[clientId]` - Get client emails
- `POST /api/client-emails/[clientId]` - Create client email

## Usage

### For Workers

1. Navigate to a client's profile
2. Go to the "Job Discovery" tab
3. Find jobs marked as "AI Applicable"
4. Click "AI Apply" to submit for AI processing
5. Go to "AI Applications" tab to review and approve applications

### For Admins

- Monitor all AI applications across clients
- Review system performance and statistics
- Manage email discovery and content generation

## Application Workflow

1. **Submission** - Worker submits AI application via Job Discovery tab
2. **Queuing** - Application added to processing queue
3. **Email Discovery** - System finds target email address
4. **Content Generation** - AI generates email and resume content
5. **Approval** - Worker reviews and approves content
6. **Delivery** - Application sent to target company

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# Email
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL=your_verified_email

# API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

### Database Setup

1. Run the schema migration:
```bash
psql -d your_database -f scripts/ai-apply-core-schema.sql
```

2. Test the schema:
```bash
node scripts/test-ai-apply-schema.js
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: n8n Integration (Planned)

- [ ] n8n workflow integration for content generation
- [ ] Advanced email discovery using multiple APIs
- [ ] Resume customization based on job requirements
- [ ] Quality validation and scoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)

- [ ] Real-time WebSocket updates
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Bulk application processing
- [ ] Custom AI models per client

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Create a test client
2. Navigate to client profile
3. Go to Job Discovery tab
4. Find an AI-applicable job
5. Click "AI Apply"
6. Check AI Applications tab for the new application
7. Review and approve the application

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run the schema test
node scripts/test-ai-apply-schema.js

# Run application tests (when implemented)
npm run test:ai-apply
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- Application processing time
- Email delivery success rate
- Worker approval rate
- System queue health

### Health Checks

The system includes built-in health monitoring:

- Queue processing status
- Failed application tracking
- Email discovery success rates
- Content generation performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Verify database server is running
   - Ensure schema is properly applied

2. **Email Delivery Failures**
   - Verify SENDGRID_API_KEY is set
   - Check VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL is valid
   - Review SendGrid account status

3. **Application Processing Issues**
   - Check queue status in AI Applications tab
   - Review error messages in application details
   - Verify client email addresses are generated

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
DEBUG=ai-apply:*
```

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints require authentication
- Client data is properly isolated
- Email addresses are generated securely
- Application content is validated before sending

## Performance

- Queue-based processing for scalability
- Cached email discovery results
- Optimized database queries
- Background processing for non-blocking operations
